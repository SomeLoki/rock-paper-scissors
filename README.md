# rock-paper-scissors

This project was to create a console only version of a rock paper scissors game. <br>

It focused on: <br>
-Capturing user input through prompt() <br>
-Passing data between functions and variables <br>
-console.log use to check your work and that you are getting the expected outcome<br>
-building functions and a bit of scope work with variables <b>

randomtest.html and randomtest.js are both extra files, they were me testing out Math.random() and Math.floor() to make sure I understood how they worked.

TOP has you come back for a rework project, adding additional context: <br>

Rework focuses on: <br>
-Use of DOM manipulation to display scores / messages to the player. <br>
-Use of event listeners to replace prompting the player for a text choice with use of buttons to play. <br>
-Removed old code and psuedocode / comments. <br>
